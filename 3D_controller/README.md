This design implements a 3D controller based on Altera's DE10-Lite FPGA.
As the FPGA board is tilted a square displayed on an external display moves accordingly
To run this design:
1. Download all files
2. Open Quartus prime software
3. Create a new project based on Altera's DE10-Lite FPGA.
4. Add the downloaded files to the project (except the pdf file)
5. Set Top.v as top level module.
6. Use the quartus tool to compile the design
7. Under the Tools tab select Programmer and program your DE10-Lite board
8. Read pdf file on how to use the design
